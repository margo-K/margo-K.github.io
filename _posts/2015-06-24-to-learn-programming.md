In my [last post](http://margorkulkarni.com/2015/06/19/data-science-handyman.html), I talked a briefly about what kind of Data Scientist I would like to be. Today I'd like to talk about how I'm planning to get there. 

One of the reasons I quit my job was so that I could spend some time building some of the skills that I don't yet have. Data science is a broad field, so I've tried to use my longer term goals to distinguish between the things I'd like to be great at and the things I am happy to put off learning until later. Even within those bounds, my list was getting pretty long, so I'm releasing this list as a series of posts, split by categories. 

I'm sharing these because I'd like to be always be a person who is not afraid to admit to what she doesn't know and what she has to work on. I've also been inspired by my friend and fellow Recurse Center alum, Oskar Thor√©n, who is great about sharing what he's [learning](http://experiments.oskarth.com/) and [working on](http://plan.oskarth.com/list). I'm also working on prioritizing the items and finding good resources, so I'd love feedback, suggestions or any other commentary. You can always reach me at margorkulkarni@gmail.com.

##Programming

### SQL

I took a databases class in college and have used both SQL- and NoSQL- based databases for various projects, but I haven't spent a lot of time learning how to write really great SQL queries. I've only recently discovered how much expressiveness there is in the language, and I'd like to more fully take advantage of it. I'm also pretty persuaded by [Jessica Kirkpatrick's](http://berkeleyjess.blogspot.de/2015/04/what-is-data-scientist.html) point that SQL should be at the top of your list to learn as a data scientist. Some of the things on my list include more effectively using window functions & partitions, building good indexes, benchmarking and optimizing queries and some [other things](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/sql-for-data-scientists.html).

### pandas

I've worked with pandas a lot over the years, but I've realized that I'm very proficient in a certain subset of its capabilities, but there are other things I've never even tried. I'd like to go through a comprehensive guide and identify the tips/recipes/best practices which I hadn't heard of and incorporate them into my daily practice.

Possible Resource: [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do). I had a copy of this when I first started learning pandas, but it might be worth going back and seeing if there's anything I missed.


### Bash
I know that there are lots of things I could do really quickly or efficiently if I knew how to use bash well for my purposes, but I haven't devoted time to learning them yet.

Possible Resource: [Data Science at the Command Line](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/)

### IPython Notebook

Used it a little bit and liked it. Could learn to use it more effectively for communicating results/insights to other people.

### MapReduce

I'm happy to learn Hadoop/Hive/Pig/etc on the job, but I'm not planning to devote time to these right now. I would, however, like to read the [original MapReduce Paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf).
