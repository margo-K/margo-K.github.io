I recently quit my job working as a Data Scientist at a small startup in Berlin. As I've started interviewing with other companies, I realized that the set of skills that I built in my last year at this company was pretty diverse - I felt decently qualified for a variety of roles, including those focused on product, marketing and machine learning. Going through this interview process has made me think a lot about the kind of data scientist I would like to be and what skills or experience I need to build to get there. Though I have strong intellectual interests in specific areas of data science and I devote time to building those skills (I am a member of a machine learning study group; I study statistics on my own), intellectual curiosity has never been sufficient to justify a path for me, though it has helped in filtering out bad ones. For me, what's always been most interesting is using some hard-earned technical (or non-technical) skills to solve real problems. This is why I switched from pure math to operations research and why I have generally always preferred having a job to being in school. 

So the conclusion I've come to is this: I want to be a data science handyman. I want to be able to dive into an undefined problem, swiftly identify the true issue and use my toolbox, with its well-worn implements, to provide a workable solution. I want to build my toolkit not based on what is sexiest or shiniest or even the most interesting tool I can find, but what is most useful and most versatile.*

\* Max Shron's book "Thinking with Data" provides an excellent walk-through of the ways of thinking that would support this (though it doesn't talk much about the specific technical skills that one also needs to do this work).
